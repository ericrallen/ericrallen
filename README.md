Currently [playing around with AI](https://hackernoon.com/ai-prompts-are-the-incantations-that-make-chatgpt-do-magical-things):

- comparing some [traditional approaches and AI-powered approaches to tasks like sentiment analysis and emotional affect detection]()
- creating an [imagination-powered music recommendation service](https://github.com/InterwebAlchemy/beat-brain)
- building a [Prompt Engineering research tool](https://github.com/InterwebAlchemy/obsidian-ai-research-assistant)

Previously [working on better dice rolls in JavaScript](https://github.com/DVDAGames/js-die-roller) and building [tools for D&D](https://github.com/DVDAGames/react-hex-flower-engine).

_P.S. - Also still building some tools for D&D, like an [AI-powered DM assistant](https://github.com/DVDAGames/local-tabletop-ai-demo)._
